## Code Snippet
hover code https://imgur.com/a/3UoF5yk
I knew how to hover and render a color but hover to render text was a little more difficult.  

## Change Log
I initially had a ton of individual js code to represent items for instructions and ingredients. Soleil helped me narrow that down and showed me how to filter through the index and show only what I needed.
